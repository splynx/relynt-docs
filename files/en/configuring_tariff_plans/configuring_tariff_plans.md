Configuring Tariff Plans
========================

This is where all your tariff plans for **services** are created, edited and stored.

In Relynt there are two types of tariff plans, namely: *Recurring* and *One-Time*.

Tariff plans are assigned to customers as services and these are the means by which we charge our customers.


**Recurring plans** are created to charge for all recurring services. <br>
**One-Time plans** are items used to charge customers once off, these are your non-recurring charges like installation fees, etc.<br>


Please follow each of the sections below for more details on configuring tariff plans:
