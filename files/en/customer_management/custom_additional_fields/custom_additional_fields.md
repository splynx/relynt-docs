Custom additional fields
==========

We have developed the ability to add additional fields to any of the modules in Relynt to collect, insert, classify or simply record any type of data in a field specially provided therefore. That is if the field is not on the system by default. 

Adding additional fields to the system can be done under Config in the System section:

Simply select the module where you'd like to add an additional field to, and click on the *Add button*.
