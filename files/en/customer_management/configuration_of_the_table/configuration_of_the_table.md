Modifying the table
==========


All tables in Relynt are customizable to view the content you prefer and in the order you prefer to see it.

By clicking on the modify <icon class="image-icon">![...](change_column_sorting.png)</icon> icon below the table then simply dragging and dropping fields you can rearrange the order thereof in a preferred layout. You can also enable or disable the fields/columns you want to display on the table.
