Customer management
=========

Customer management can be a very tedious and time consuming task. Thanks to the Relynt customer module, with automation and integrated systems, customer management can be handled fast and efficiently.

The customer management system consists of 6 main pages for each customer on the system. Namely, information, services, billing, documents, CRM, and communication.


Before we explore each section, it is vital to know that this module's tables like all the others within Relynt, is customizable to display information of your preference, furthermore, you are not limited by the fields available in the system by default.

Tables within Relynt can always be adjusted for whichever purpose to display whatever available data and "Additional Fields" can be created to capture data you might find necessary which may not be included in the default fields.
