The Dashboard in Relynt is a quick overview of the system with useful statistics on each of the modules.

At the top of the live dashboard you are presented with the number of Active customers, the number of new customers, new and open tickets, as well as the number of blocked customers. This information is summarized and displayed on info boxes and if you need more detailed lists of the data provided in the boxes, we've conveniently added view buttons to the boxes so you can quickly navigate to the full lists.
