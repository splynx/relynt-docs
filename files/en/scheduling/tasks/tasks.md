Tasks
======

Every project has various tasks that we can create and assign to a specific administrator. Tasks can be created by clicking the **Add** button under `Scheduling > Tasks` in the list view, or by simply clicking the *=* icon of a status in the Workflow view. *Please note, you first have to select a project to create tasks*

It is possible to create task templates to optimize the routine/process of adding new tasks. Templates will populate the fields with preset data you have configured for the template. You can create your own templates under `Config > Scheduling > Task templates`.
