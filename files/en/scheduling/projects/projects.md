The main menu of the scheduling module, displaying a list of all your projects at hand. With each project representing how many tasks it consists of, in each of its relevant statuses within the Workflow.

**Reminder**: Just like all lists in Splynx, the data displayed can be customized
to your preference by using the breadcrumbs icon at the bottom of each list. ![Content icon](content_icon.jpg)
