Scheduling Dashboard
=========
Our scheduling dashboard provides a convenient overview of all scheduling related data.

It is our centralized monitoring page to manage your scheduling module and quickly access your different sub-modules.

Here we can see our Tasks assigned to the current administrator, all tasks, activities within the scheduling module and some statistic of tasks created VS resolved tasks.
