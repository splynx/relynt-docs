Once you have filtered the table/report to display data of your preference, you can then generate the statment by clicking on the "Generate PDF" button located within the filter.
Upon clicking this button,once the statement is ready, the Generate button will change into a "Download generated" button, which can be used to download a ZIP file containing PDF statements for each customer according to the data criteria you have specified in the filter. After generating a statement, the option to send it to the customers will also become available for you to send each customer their statements:
