### Settings for recurring billing

#### *Recurring type of billing is set by default in Relynt global configuration.*<br>

![billing_settings](billing_settings.png)

* **Billing Enabled** -  enables/disables billing for the customer;

* **Period** -  it can be prepaid or postpaid, which means in Prepaid Mode recurring Invoices can be issued up to 5 months in advance and in Postpaid Mode Invoices will be generated after services usage;

* **Payment Method** - select a Payment Method for recurring payments, such as Cash, Bank Transfer, Credit Card, PayPal, Refill Card, BrainTree and others if installed and configured;

* **Billing day** - when the customer will be charged. It is a day of Invoice generation.
If the 'use date of creating customer' options is enabled - the billing day will be set to the day the customer was created;

* **Billing due** - the last day customers have to make payments before getting blocked. For example, if we choose the 1st day of the month as the billing day and the 15th day of the month as the Billing due day, Invoices will be generated on the 1st day of the month and if customer don't make payments by the 15th day of the month, the customer will be blocked on the 16th day of the month. Even though the customer will have a blocked status, their services will be still accounted;

* **Deactivation Period** - when the customer's services will be disabled and the customer will be given an inactive status, after the customer has been blocked. For e.g. it could be 10 days, which means 10 days after the customer has been blocked, the customer's status will automatically be changed from blocked to inactive and their services will not be accounted;

* **Minimal balance** - defines the minimum amount of funds to be available in the customers account at all times, after service charges, to avoid being blocked and is set, by default, to "0" in Global configuration, but it is possible to change it here according to your needs;

* **Send finance notifications** - enables/disables sending of notifications about payments, invoices, overdue invoices etc;

* **Payment calendar** - enables/disables payment calendars under the customers "Billing" tab.

### Billing Prepaid (custom) settings

![prepaid settings](prepay.png)

* **Text of item** - Specify the text/title of the line item on the invoices.

* **Tax** - select a tax amount to add to invoices.

* **Deactivation period** - select the amount of days prepaid customers have to make payments after their service expiration dates/being blocked, to avoid being marked as inactive.

### Proforma Invoice settings

![Proforma](proforma_settings.png)

These are the parameters for auto generating Proforma Invoices. In our billing system Proforma Invoices can be used as a request of payment in advance. For example, it can be created 1 month before the recurring payment, so you will see if the customer is able to pay the Proforma Invoice. When the proforma invoice is created, the customerâ€™s balance doesn't changed. The main reason for this billing approach is to prevent the payment of VAT tax for non-paying customers. If the customer pays the amount specified in the Proforma Invoice PDF, the company can issue a tax Invoice thereafter.

* **Enable Auto Proforma Invoices** - with this option enabled Proforma Invoices will be issued automatically;
* **Day of generating Auto Proforma Invoices** - select the day for automatic issuing of Proforma Invoices;
* **Period** - select the period to generate proforma invoice for;  
* **Create Proforma Invoices for** - there are 2 options here: create proforma invoice for current month or for the next month;
* **Proforma Invoice number pattern** - create a Proforma Invoice number pattern here.




## Mass update of customers' billing Settings

Using the mass update tool, billing settings can be configured for multiple amounts of customers at once instead of manually changing billing settings for each customer. Be very attentive when using this tool. Here are a few examples on how to use it:

**Task 1**: disable billing for the partner "Person" and for customers using the billing type = recurring:

![mass update 1](mass_update.png)

After billing was disabled in settings click on "Update existing customers" select the partner, billing type and only the "billing enabled" value and click on the "Update" button.

**Task 2** : Change the billing day for all existing customers.

![mass update 2](mass_update2.png)

Using the same logic select all partners, all billing types and just the value "billing day" for Attributes to update and click on the "Update" button.
