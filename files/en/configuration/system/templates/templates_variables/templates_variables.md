     <div style="text-align: justify"><h4>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR â€˜BEST FIBREâ€™ SERVICES</h4>
     This Subscriber Agreement (â€œAgreementâ€) is made by and between Subscriber and JS BEST ISP Limited. (â€œBEST ISPâ€), forÂ the provision and use of â€˜BRDY Fibreâ€™ Internet access (the â€œServiceâ€).
     Now therefore, in consideration of theÂ mutual promises and covenants herein contained, the adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, and intendingÂ to be legally bound, Subscriber and BEST ISP hereby agree as follows:
     <h4>1. AGREEMENT.</h4>Subscriber agrees to be bound by this Agreement and to use the Service in compliance with the terms of thisÂ Agreement and with BEST ISPâ€™s Acceptable Usage Policy and any modifications made to same from time to time.
     <h4>2. THE SUBSCRIBER.</h4>The Subscriber is at least 18 years of age, is legally able to enter into contracts and is responsible for this SubscriberÂ account. The Subscriber shall pay all fees, taxes, charges and other expenses incurred in connection with theÂ account.
     <h4>3. SUBSCRIBER ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS REGARDING THE SERVICE.</h4>
     (a)Â The Service consists of a VDSL internet connection over a copper phone line. While BEST ISP will undertake allÂ reasonable commercial efforts to deliver the stated service the Subscriber acknowledges that service speed canÂ vary depending on distance, Internet traffic and other factors beyond the control of BEST ISP. The Service mayÂ contain material that is unsuitable for minors and The Subscriber acknowledges that BEST ISP does not and cannotÂ filter the content.
     <br>
     (b)Â The Subscriber acknowledges that in order to provide the Service, BEST ISP has contracted with communicationsÂ and network operators for internet access.

     <br>
     (c) The Â Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that from time to time BEST ISP may be required to temporarily suspendÂ the Service to subscriber to verify compliance with applicable licenses, authorizations, and compliance with theÂ technical and operating parameters of the network. Under such circumstances BEST ISP will use all reasonableÂ efforts to minimize disruption to the Service including making reasonable efforts that any such suspension takeÂ place out of normal business hours.
     <br>
     (d)Â The Subscriber accepts that BEST ISP may change or withdraw any element of the Service from time to time andÂ will use all reasonable efforts to notify Subscriber of any necessary change in the Services.
     <br>
     (e) The SubscriberÂ acknowledges that the Service is an â€œalways openâ€ connection to the internet while the equipment is powered onÂ and that it is Subscriberâ€™s SOLE RESPONSIBILITY to install, configure and maintain suitable security measuresÂ to protect The Subscriberâ€™s computer and equipment from unauthorised or malicious access from the internet. AnyÂ advice or equipment provided by BEST ISP is provided â€˜as isâ€™ and BEST ISP accepts no responsibility or liability forÂ the security of Subscriberâ€™s systems.

     (a)Â From service activation BEST ISP will loan certain VDSL modem and associated equipment, hereafter termedÂ â€œEquipmentâ€, to The Subscriber to access the service. This Equipment at all times remains the sole property ofÂ BEST ISP and The Subscriber agrees to provide BEST ISP access and permission to recover said equipment on demandÂ without delay, obstruction or interference.
     <br>
     (b) The Â Subscriber agrees to use the Equipment in accordance with BEST ISPâ€™s instructions and to restrict access toÂ the Equipment to only those representatives and agents authorized by BEST ISP. The Subscriber agrees to takeÂ reasonable steps to protect the Equipment from damage, loss or theft.
     <br>
     (c)Â The Subscriber agrees to notify BEST ISP as soon as reasonably possible once he becomes aware of any damageÂ to the equipment or defect in the operation of the equipment by telephoning or emailing BEST ISP at the numbersÂ or addresses published from time to time, or office@bestisp.com
     <br>
     (d)Â On termination or cancellation of the Service Contract for any reason whatsoever, it is the responsibility of theÂ Subscriber to return by recorded mail in good condition and suitably packaged, the VDSL Modem and any otherÂ related equipment provided by BEST ISP. Failure to return equipment within 14 days of the serviceÂ termination/cancellation date will generate an automatic equipment fee of â‚¬99 including VAT which will beÂ deducted from The Subscribers account and The Subscriber hereby agrees to same.
     <br>
     <h4>5. TERM.</h4>
     (a)Â This Agreement is for an initial term of 6, 12 or 18 months, as defined by your price plan rules, and shallÂ automatically renew for subsequent month term, until terminated in accordance with this Agreement. After theÂ Initial Term, The Subscriber may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to BEST ISP.
     <br>
     (b)Â Should The Subscriber terminate this agreement for any reason during the initial term, a cancellation fee equal toÂ the remainder of the contract term will become immediately due, and The Subscriber acknowledges and agrees toÂ pay such fee and return any equipment provided.

     <br>
     (d)Â BEST ISP may in its sole discretion terminate this Agreement at any time. In the event that BEST ISP terminatesÂ this Agreement for reasons other than breach of this Agreement by Subscriber, then BEST ISP shall endeavour toÂ the extent reasonably possible to provide 30 days notice to The Subscriber. The Subscriber is liable under this AgreementÂ for all fees and charges until such time as the Agreement has been terminated. THE SUBSCRIBER UNDERSTANDS THAT UNLESS WRITTEN NOTIFICATION IS RECEIVED BY BEST ISP AFTER THE INITIAL TERM, THEÂ SERVICE SHALL CONTINUE AND SUBSCRIBER WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENTÂ OF APPLICABLE SERVICE FEES.

     <div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>
     <h4>6. TERMINATION.</h4><br>
     (a)Â If Subscriber is dissatisfied with the Service or any related terms, conditions, rules, policies, guidelines, orÂ practices, and if these issues cannot be resolved through BEST ISPâ€™s Customer Complaints procedure,Â The Subscriberâ€™s sole remedy is to discontinue using the Service, cancel the account, and pay any cancellation feesÂ that apply. To cancel the Service The Subscriber must send a written request for termination by email to BEST ISPÂ and same must be signed by an authorised representative of The Subscriber to arrive not less than 5 working daysÂ before the end of the current billing term. Should The Subscriber terminate this agreement during the initial term forÂ any reason other than a failure by BEST ISP to provide Internet Access service for a period in excess of 5 days, aÂ cancellation fee equal the remainder of the contract term will become immediately due, and The SubscriberÂ acknowledges and agrees to pay such fee.
     <br>
     (b)Â Upon cancellation or otherwise upon termination of this Agreement, related email and hosting services will beÂ terminated and all the Subscriber files stored on BEST ISP servers may be deleted. BEST ISP may terminate thisÂ Agreement, your password, your account, or your use of the Services for any reason, including, without limitation,Â if BEST ISP, in its sole discretion, believes you have violated the Agreements or if The Subscriber fails to pay anyÂ charges when due.
     <br>
     (c)Â Sections 11, 20, 21, and 22 of this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.
     <br>

     <h4>7. FEES AND PAYMENT</h4><br>
     (a)Â Subscriber shall pay a monthly service fee and all other applicable fees, charges, taxes, and other amountsÂ for the Service at the rates in effect for the current billing period. BEST ISP may increase or decrease the monthlyÂ service fee. BEST ISP will use all reasonable efforts to provide The Subscriber thirty (30) days or more notice of same.Â If such changes to the basic monthly service fee are to The Subscribers detriment (e.g. a price increase), The SubscriberÂ may terminate this agreement by giving thirty (30) days written notice, and The Subscriber will remain liable only forÂ any balance on the account.
     <br>
     (b)Â Payment is due in full by Credit Card or Direct Debit at the start of each billing month. All charges areÂ considered valid unless disputed in writing within thirty (30) days of the billing date. Adjustments will not be madeÂ for charges that are more than 30 days old. If any payment is more than 7 days overdue or is returned by theÂ bank unpaid, the Service may be suspended with immediate effect and remain suspended until the due amountsÂ are paid in full. The Subscriber is not relieved of the obligation to pay the monthly service fee while an account isÂ suspended. BEST ISP may at its sole discretion terminate the Service and this Agreement for any accounts whichÂ are 14 days or more overdue. A reactivation fee or deposit may be required before Service is reactivated afterÂ suspension or termination. Credit account balances shall not accrue interest. The Subscriber agrees to pay theÂ reasonable costs of any collection agency, solicitor or court used by BEST ISP to collect past due amounts or toÂ enforce this Agreement. Returned cheques or Direct Debits will incur a â‚¬5 administration fee.
     <br>
     (c)Â A â‚¬1.50 inclusive of VAT charge applies to all bills for non-Direct Debit customers.(d)Â Where a package is downgraded within contract, a â‚¬30 inclusive of VAT downgrade fee applies.
