SMS sending configuration
=========

Relynt supports sending of SMS's using different SMS gateways. To configure SMS sending you need to find a suitable SMS gateway and set up Relynt to work with it.

To configure SMS sending in Relynt navigate to `Config → Main → SMS`.

**NOTE! Configuration will be unique for each SMS gateway.**

**SMS logs can be found under [`Administration - Logs - SMS`](administration/logs/sms/sms.md) or under ` Messages - Mass sending - History`**

## Main
* **Gateway URL** - specify the URL of the SMS gateway(should be specified in gateway documentation);
* **Payload** - request payload for sending SMS. Depends on content type(JSON or x-www-form-urlencoded) and syntax provided by SMS gateway;
* **Method** - select the method to call the gateway (POST or GET);
* **Content type** - how to handle the payload (JSON or x-www-form-urlencoded). JSON can be used only with POST method;
* **Enable SMS sending** - enables/disables SMS sending from Relynt;
* **Debug** - enables/disables debug to log file */var/www/Relynt/logs/cron/sms.log*;
* **Successful response** - if the SMS gateway returns a specific successful response it should be configured here so that Relynt can know which SMS was sent;
* **Days to expire** - how many days the server will try to send an SMS. Thereafter it will be marked as "Error".

## Check SMS balance
