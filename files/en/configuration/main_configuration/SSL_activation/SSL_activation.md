SSL Activation
===============

_SSL Activation_ - allows you to change your connection from "http" to "https" and vice versa.

SSL certification is important as it ensures that the data going from the userâ€™s computer to the website stays secure and unreadable to any malicious intruders like hackers and identity thieves, as well as any other third parties.

Also, it is important to have SSL configured if you intend on using the Relynt mobile applications.

**_To change your connection from "http" to "https" you need to have a domain name._**

If you have a domain name and you want to change the connection, navigate to *Config -> Main -> HTTPS/SSL*:
