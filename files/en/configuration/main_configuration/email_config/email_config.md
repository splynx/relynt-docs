We do recommend using an Email Delivery Service such as https://www.sparkpost.com/ , if you do not have email sending services/your services are not compatible.

## Google mail Example
To use your Google mail account for email sending, please fill in the following fields:

Parameter|Value
---|---
**Sender's email** | your email (email@gmail.com)
**Transport type** | SMTP
**Host** | smtp.gmail.com
**Port** | 465
**Verify SSL certificate** | enabled
**Encrypted** | SSL
**Use authentication** | enabled
**Username** | your username. Full email (email@gmail.com)
**Password** | your password. Google account password

Please note, the following changes need to be made to your Google account to use your Google email to send emails via the Relynt server:  
1. You should allow less secure apps to use your Google account (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255);
2. Google limits number of letters per day (https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852?hl=en);
3. Sometimes Google does not allow sending letters due to security reasons. In this case you should enter into account via browser and confirm that it was you (trying to send email recently).
