This is the easiest method of installing any add-on or integrating software on Relynt.


Once here, you will be provided with a list of add-on's which you can install, reinstall or delete. You can also click on the `i` icon to retrieve information on the add-on.

You can either locate the add-on you wish to install manually or simply use the search bar provided to search for the add-on by specific text.

 The list will also display addons which you have already installed by highlighting the "Package" name in blue. Also, add-ons with a "Version" number highlighted in yellow, indicates that an update is available for the add-on. If the version is highlighted in green, this means that the add-on is up to date.

 Updates can be installed by clicking on the install icon or via the "Update(apt)" button:
