## Converting a lead to a customer

The main goal of the CRM module is to achieve converting prospective customers into subscribers of your services.

Clicking on the Convert function on the lead page will initiate the conversion of a lead into a customer on the system.

The process consists of the following steps:

1. **Select the quote/s** - quotes that will be used to create the customer's services. (The services quoted and agreed upon).

We can choose to complete the conversion within this step by clicking *convert now*, skipping the services step, or continue to the services step to confirm the service details.

3. **Services** - The final step, allowing us to edit the service details of the quote we selected in step 1.
Once all details have been confirmed, we can complete the process by clicking on *convert to customer*.
